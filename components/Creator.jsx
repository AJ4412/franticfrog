            At a Sunday family dinner, our children began discussing a new cool form of art called NFTs.  Diane, who is a conventional visual artist, specifically became interested.
            She thought this would be an invigorating change.  Inspired by the existing NFTs at that time, the idea of frog characters seemed just right, so she created a few frogs using the program paintbrush, one at a time.
            Her children and she liked her creation, so her daughter told her, “Now, just create an NFT collection of 10,000 different frogs.” This seemed like a nonstarter to Diane.  
            However, Edwin, Diane's husband, who is an art critic of just one artist, Diane, saw the NFT project as a way that he could actively participate with Diane in creating art, so he got involved in the NFT challenge.  
            <br /> <br />Edwin wholeheartedly got into this project and figured out how to use computer technology to create a layered art collection, deploy an ERC 721A contract, mint the NFT collection on OpenSea, create this Website, and minting dAPP.  
            <br /> <br />Together, Edwin and Diane began to design Frankie and all of his attributes. This was a fun project, and together they made a great team. They shared design ideas. The Frantic Frog NFT collection ended up with 16 layers and 200 attributes, and Edwin who is an ophthalmic microsurgeon used his abilities of precision and spatial perception needed so that the over quadrillion possibilities that the 16 art layers would produce would fit together resulting in the most original 10,000 art tokens ever.  
            Each layer has special rarities occurring about 0.32% of the 10,000 NFTs.  Rarity traits are listed in OpenSea.  
            <br /> <br />From learning to design digital art to creating this website with the minting dAPP has been about a nine-month project.  We are happy to have brought the Frantic Frog NTF collection and the character of Frankie Frantic Frog (AKA FCUBE) to you.  Collect and enjoy the Frantic Frog Collection and be a part of the FCUBE Community. See Frankie's Story and the Road Map to learn more about FCUBE. It is only the beginning as we have discovered FCUBE is a superhero and has quite a mission ahead.
