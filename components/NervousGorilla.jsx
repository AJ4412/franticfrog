            Frankie was born Francis, one of 600 tadpoles, in a radioactive puddle in Staten Island.  As a youngster, he began to have aspirations of becoming more than he was when he realized that he could be both a tadpole and a pollywog.  Frankie’s parents were June, a bookkeeper at her family’s fly-loffel eatery, and Wood, a flylanderer who hopped from one Lily pad to another.  Both parents were born and raised in the New York Harbor.  Frankie’s grandparents were immigrants from Yearn Gully.  They spoke knee-deep, croak, and ribbit.  As a result of growing up in a multilingual family, Frankie had a gift for gab, and as he metamorphosized into a young toad, he affectionately became known as “Bullfrog” in the neighborhood.
            <br /><br />When Frankie left the neighborhood, he got a job as a frog in your throat, which he did not relish, since he preferred fruit flies.  Since he found this work in bad taste, he began to crack croaks.  His philosophy was not, “Time flies when you’re having fun”, but it  was, “Time’s fun when you’re having flies.  Frankie could not take the job seriously, since he always had earnest aspirations of being more than he was.  One day while he was working on making someone horse in the throat, which was no small task since he was a frog, Master Leap-Frog, a Superhero Frog, descended making Frankie 10,000 unique Frogs, thus bestowing Superhero qualities to Frankie.  Needing to keep track of all of these unique Frogs, made Frankie very frantic, so he took on the name of Frankie Frantic Frog, otherwise known in Superhero lore as FCUBE.
            <br /><br />On one occasion, as his 10,000 unique frogs were spanning the Universe and Metaverse, FCUBE noticed that an Amish community was having extreme difficulty baking their Shoofly Pies for their annual Black Buggy Day Festival.  Millions of flies invaded the community, preventing the pies from being ready for the festival.  They were the proverbial  fly in the ointment so to speak, but millions of times over. ``♫ Having warts. not hair, FCUBE is there ♫”.   Zing, Zap, Zoom !!!.  In a Zorro-escque fashion with his tongue, Frankie Frantic Frog expunged all signs of flies around the festival.  FCUBE made the Amish community a no fly zone, opening up pie production once again.  As a result of his “Open Fly“ policy and resumed production of Shoofly Pies, the Black Buggy Day Festival added a Frog Jumping Contest to lead off into their headliner The Skillet Toss Contest.
            <br /><br />Having taken on the persona of FCUBE, Frankie immersed himself into cubism.  He was all cubic all the time.  There was nothing about cubism that didn’t fascinate Frankie.  He never drinks water over crushed ice, only cubed ice.  In fact, his favorite celebrity is Ice Cube, whom he hopes to meet someday.  Besides winning The Frog Jumping Contest at The Black Buggy Day Festival, Frankie uses his four legs to solve two Rubik’s Cubes at the same time.  He loves the cubism art of Pablo Picasso and George Braque, with Picasso’s  Les Demoiselles d’ Avignon being his favorite.  In addition, he loves toy blocks,  dice, and sugar cubes (the sugar cubes also since they attract flies).
            <br /><br />Whether munching on flies, raising the awareness of cubism, or just plain rescuing the Universe and Metaverse, what is most concerning to Frankie, what really drives Frankie Frantic Frog, what FCUBE wants the most is that you should enjoy one or more his 10,000 NFTs in his NFT collection.
